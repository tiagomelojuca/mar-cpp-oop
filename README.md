# mar-cpp-oop

Repo created for store all the exercises done over [OOP Paradigm with C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/aprendendo-a-programar-em-c-plus-plus/) from Marco Aur√©lio Regis.  
  
Please note that all exercises are very simple. This course was done just to complement the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming within C++, covered only as a overview by another course (referred in [this repo](https://github.com/tiagomelojuca/cod3r-cpp-essential/)), also for beginners. Both were done aiming the same job interview, the one referred in the another repo.
